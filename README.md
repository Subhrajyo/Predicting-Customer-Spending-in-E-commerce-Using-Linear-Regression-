To determine whether optimizing the mobile app experience or the website experience would have a 
greater impact on customer spending and engagement for the e-commerce company. 
This objective will be achieved by analyzing the relationship between various customer attributes (Avg. Session 
Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership) and customer spending. By understanding 
which platform (mobile app or website) has a stronger correlation with customer behavior and spending, the 
company can prioritize its efforts accordingly.
 It can be tricky to interpret the information in this analysis. According to the model, the most significant factor 
for clients is not the time spent on the app or website, but their length of membership. However, of the two 
predictors (desktop vs app), the app has the strongest influence by far. In fact, the time spent on the desktop 
website does not seem to have any correlation at all! In other words, according to the data, the amount of time 
that the customer spends on the desktop website has almost nothing to do with the amount of money they will 
spend. We could interpret this in two different ways. Firstly, this could mean that the desktop website needs 
more work to make its visitors buy more. Secondly, it could mean that people tend to be more influenced by 
mobile applications of online stores than by desktop websites. So maybe efforts should be directed towards 
taking advantage of this fact. Indeed, the interpretation of this information requires expertise in the online 
marketing sphere. Our analysis and our model, however, does a very good job in weighting the predictors 
importance.
